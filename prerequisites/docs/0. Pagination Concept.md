## **What is Pagination?**

**Definition:** Pagination is the process of breaking down large sets of data into smaller, manageable chunks or "pages" to improve usability and performance.

**Real-World Analogy:** Think of a book with numbered pages. Instead of reading the entire book in one go, you read it page by page.

### **Why Use Pagination?**

**1. User Experience:**

- Imagine scrolling through thousands of records on a single page. Pagination makes it easier for users to consume and navigate content.

**2. Performance Optimization:**

- Instead of fetching and displaying all records at once, pagination retrieves only a subset, reducing server and client load.

**3. Scalability:**

- Pagination ensures your application can handle large datasets efficiently without crashing or slowing down.

## **Real-World Examples**

**1. Search Engines**:

- Google paginates search results, typically showing 10 results per page.

**2. E-commerce Websites:**

- Products are displayed in pages for easy navigation.

**3. Social Media Feeds:**

- Infinite scrolling loads new content dynamically (a form of pagination).
